# Configurations

This is the Configurations folder of my personal repository. Below, I list its contents.

## dotfiles

This folder keeps all the relevant configuration files (no, not only .dotfiles) of my PC. I do not use a symlink approach, I found best to create the [sync_dotfiles.ps1](dotfiles\sync_dotfiles.ps1) script and run it once in a while.
