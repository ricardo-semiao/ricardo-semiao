# Guidelines for Programming scripts

## Style Guide

- Do not remove empty lines when editing code, even consecutive ones.

### Comments

- In code, use comments to explain the "why" not the "what" or "how".
- Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space, followed by a capital letter.
