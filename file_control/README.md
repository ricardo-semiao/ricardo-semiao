# File Control

This is the File Control folder of my personal repository. Below, I list its contents.

There are three scripts, that help me control the files in my machines. All of them output file path analytics to a "text/" folder, but that is not uploaded to GitHub.

- "find_paths.ps1" is used to find folder names that aren't in conformity with my chosen style: sentence case for general folders, and snake-case for programming projects.
- "find_prog_projects.ps1" is used to find folders that contain programming projects, i.e., have a ".RProj" or a ".code-workspace" file in them.
- "find_symlinks" is used to find symlinks in my machine, and output whether they are valid or have been broken.
